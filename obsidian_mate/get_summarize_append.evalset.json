For example, \"Generate a list of 5 potential solutions to reduce carbon emissions.\"\n\n2. **Context:** Adding context can enhance the quality of responses. Compare:  \n   - Without context: \"Write a science fiction story.\"  \n   - With context: \"Write a science fiction story set in a post-apocalyptic future where humans coexist with sentient machines.\"\n\n3. **Examples:** Giving examples helps guide the model’s responses effectively. For instance, in designing a workout, without examples it's just \"Design a full-body workout routine,\" but with an example it becomes, \"Design a workout routine similar to HIIT with low-impact exercises.\"\n\n4. **Role:** Define the role to provide tailored responses. Example: \"Give travel advice for someone visiting Japan\" vs. \"As a long-time resident of Japan, give advice to someone visiting Japan for the first time.\"\n\n5. **Tone:** Specify the tone required for the response. A reminder about an upcoming deadline can be conveyed as a friendly yet urgent message.\n\n6. **Intended Audience:** Tailor explanations based on the audience's background, e.g., explaining blockchain technology to someone with no technical background.\n\n7. **Output Format:** Define how the output should be structured (e.g., in table or JSON format).\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining these components effectively will lead to better-crafted prompts and more meaningful responses from AI models."
